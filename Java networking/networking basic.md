## Java Networking:
               Java Networking is a concept of connecting 2 or more computing Devices
               Together so that they can share the Resourses.
 
* # Basic Terminologies:

  ## IP Address:
             1] An IP Address is a unique no. which is assign to node of network.
              eg. 192.168.2.2.
             2] Range From 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255
             3] It is a logical Address that can be changed.
  ## Protocol:
            1] A protocol is a set of rules whaich are followed for the communication.
            2] Eg. TCP,FTP,SMTP,Telnet
  ## Port Number.:
            1] It is Used to uniquely identify diff. application. It acts as a communication endpoint betn application.
            2] The port no. is associated with IP Add. for communication betn. 2 appln.
  ## MAC address:
            1] MAC(Media access Control) Adress is a unique identifier of NIC( Network Interface Controller)
            2] A network Node can have Multiple NIC but each with unique MAC.
  ## Connection-Oriented and Connection-less Protocol
           1] Connection-Oriented :
                        - in C.O.P Ack. is send by the receiver.
                        - It is Reliable but slow.
                        - Eg. TCP
           2] Connection-less Protocol:
                        - In C.L.P Ack. is not sent by the receiver.
                        - it is not reliable but fast.
                        - packets are send even if they are not received by receiver.
                        - Eg.:UDP 
  ## Sockets:
         - Server and client have network end points called as Socket.
         - Sockets are bound to specific Port.
         - Socket= IP+ port No.

 * # Basic of Networking:
     ## Proxy Server: 
         It is An Alternative Server Which give All Permission to client
     ## Internate Address:
         It is a Number Which uniquely identifies Each computer over network.
     ## Domain Name Server:
         It is name of Internet Address.
